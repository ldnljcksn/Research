This repo is for Lee D. Jackson's research with Neil Calkin at Clemson
University.  The goal of this project is to use a neural net to attempt to
simulate the neurons and synapses of the brain, with the hope of finding some
pattern.

NOTE: Please disregard the folder named "Java." I thought about doing some
work on the project in Java but never followed through on it. I simply can't
remove the folder from the repo, even though it's deleted from my computer.
